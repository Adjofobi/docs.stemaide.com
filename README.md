 As you unbox your STEMAIDE Kit, you embark on an exciting adventure filled with hands-on exploration, creativity, and innovation. To help you get started and maximize the benefits of your STEMAIDE kit, we have put together a comprehensive set of guides and resources. These guides are designed to walk you through every step of the process, from unboxing your STEMAIDE Kit to utilizing its full features. Whether you are a seasoned pro or completely new to this, our guides are crafted to cater to all levels of expertise.

# Getting Started
Here's a quick overview of what you can expect from our guides:

<summary>The Arduino IDE and Basic Set Up</summary>
**Step 1:** Double click on the Arduino IDE icon on your computer / laptop to open Arduino IDE.

|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|

_**NB:** we will write the necessary code and comment at the space we created above the void setup ()._

## Comment
In programming, a comment is a piece of text that is added to the source code of a program to provide information or explanations. Comments are intended for human readers and are ignored by the compiler or interpreter when the program is executed.
